# Product Images

This folder contains placeholder images for all products in the Hedamo disclosure system.

## Placeholder Images

The current files (1.svg through 12.svg) are placeholder images that display the product number. These are meant to be replaced with actual product images.

## How to Replace Placeholders

To add real product images:

1. Prepare your product images (recommended formats: JPG, PNG, or SVG)
2. Name them according to the product ID (e.g., `1.jpg`, `2.png`, `3.svg`, etc.)
3. Replace the corresponding placeholder file in this folder
4. The images will automatically appear in the application
